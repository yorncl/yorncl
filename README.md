### Hi

Hello, my name is Martin. I do computer things. I sometimes hang out at [42 Paris](https://42.fr). I like systems programming in C/Rust, Linux related things, and dabble in webdev when I'm feeling like shooting myself in the foot.

Here are some of my school projects : 
* [minirt](https://github.com/yorncl/minirt) : A minimal raytracer written in C
* [scop](https://github.com/yorncl/scop) : A small program that parses and renders simple obj files from scratch with OpenGL.
* [ft_containers](https://github.com/yorncl/ft_containers) : An implementation of the most common STL containers in C++
* [ft_transcendance](https://github.com/Trbonnes/ft_transcendance) : Group project, a full-stack web application to play pong with your friends (NestJS + Nuxt w/ typescript)
* [webserver](https://github.com/paulineggf/webserver) : Group project, an implementation of a web server based on Nginx for HTTP/1.1 in C++
* ft_linux: a custom linux distribution (linux from scratch), includes KDE Plasma 5
* [minishell](https://github.com/tvideira/minishell) : Group project, an implementation of a shell mimicking bash behaviour.

Here are some stupid ideas that I took the time to implement: 
* [snake-bootloader](https://github.com/yorncl/snake-bootloader) : A snake game fitting into 256 bytes that you can boot in a virtual machine or on real hardware
* [QwertyRace](https://github.com/yorncl/qwertyrace) : A game where you have to type qwerty over and over as fast as possible

Honorable mentions:
* [mojitOS](https://github.com/yorncl/mojitOS) : a x86 kernel written in Rust, with high ambitions but with a high probability of lying unfinished (currently with a few hardware drivers, memory management, interrupts handling, and basic kernel threads)
