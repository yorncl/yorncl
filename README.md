### Hi

Hello, my name is Martin. I study Computer Science at [42 Paris](https://42.fr)

Here are some of my projects : 
	- [minirt] (git@github.com:yorncl/minirt.git) : A minimal raytracer written in C
	- [ft_containers](https://github.com/yorncl/ft_containers) : An implementation of the most common STL containers in C++
	- [ft_transcendance](https://github.com/Trbonnes/ft_transcendance) : Group project, a full-stack web application to play pong with your friends (NestJS + Nuxt w/ typescript)
	- [webserver](https://github.com/paulineggf/webserver) : Group project, an implementation of a web server based on Nginx for HTTP/1.1 in C++
	- ft_linux: a custom linux distribution (linux from scratch), includes KDE Plasma 5


Here are some stupid ideas that I took the time to implement: 
	- [snake-bootloader](https://github.com/yorncl/snake-bootloader) : A snake game fitting into 256 bytes that you can boot in a virtual machine or on real hardware
	- [QwertyRace](https://github.com/yorncl/qwertyrace) : A game where you have to type qwerty over and over as fast as possible
	- [barrier_sempahore](https://github.com/yorncl/barrier_semaphore) : A minimal implementation of the barrier API with sempaphores in C
